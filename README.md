## Hi there 👋
## I’m Fahmi 👋

I’m a physician working across biomedical data science, biostatistics,
and applied machine learning.

### Glimpse of my weirdos🤔
I often reason in terms of types, trade-offs, and edge cases —
habits shaped by clinical work, data analysis, and, occasionally, Pokémon😽

I think some intuition around uncertainty comes from small and low-stakes trials,
where outcomes are partially hidden, and expectations must adapt,
— definitely like blind boxes from the Popmart — 

I’m drawn to systems that are modular, engineered, and constraint-driven.
Whether it’s a surgical workflow, a data pipeline, or some Gundam manuals🛠️

And yes — I also have patience for long work.
If I should tell you how is my endurance, ofc it's on One Piece lover's level😤

### I am not losing in my daily life though..⚡⚡⚡⚡🎃
- Medical doctor with clinical and research experience
- Work spanning clinical data, biosignal, omics, and imaging
- Ongoing interest in biomedical AI, decision systems, and applied analytics
