## Hi there, Fahmi is here 👋

I’m a physician working across biomedical data science, biostatistics,
and applied machine learning.

### Glimpse of my weirdos🤔
I often reason in terms of types, trade-offs, and edge cases —
habits shaped by clinical work, data analysis, and, ofc, Pokémon🔥

Life is about running on uncertainty, we should takes small and low-stakes trials,
where outcomes are partially hidden, and expectations must adapt,
— definitely like blind boxes from the Popmart — 

I’m drawn to systems that are modular, engineered, and constraint-driven.
Whether it’s a surgical scalpel, a data pipeline, or some Gundam manuals

And yes — I also have patience for long work.
If I should tell you how is my endurance, I could chunk One Piece nonstop😤

### My Background ._.
- Medical doctor with clinical and research experience
- Work spanning clinical data, biosignal, omics, and imaging
- Ongoing interest in biomedical AI, decision systems, and applied analytics
